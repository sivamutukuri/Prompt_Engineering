            "    * **Answer:** Supervised learning uses labeled data (input features and corresponding output variables) to train a model to predict outcomes on new, unseen data. Examples include linear regression (predicting house prices based on size and location) and image classification (identifying cats vs. dogs in images). Unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data to discover patterns and structures within the data. Examples include clustering (grouping customers based on purchasing behavior) and dimensionality reduction (reducing the number of variables in a dataset while retaining important information).\n",

            "    * **Answer:** The bias-variance tradeoff describes the balance between a model's ability to fit the training data (low bias) and its ability to generalize to new data (low variance). High bias leads to underfitting (the model is too simple and doesn't capture the underlying patterns), while high variance leads to overfitting (the model is too complex and memorizes the training data, performing poorly on new data).  A good model strikes a balance between these two.  For example, a linear regression model might have high bias if the relationship is actually non-linear, while a very high-degree polynomial model might have high variance.\n",

            "    * **Answer:**  The p-value is the probability of observing the obtained results (or more extreme results) if the null hypothesis is true.  A small p-value (typically below a significance level, like 0.05) suggests that the null hypothesis is unlikely, providing evidence to reject it in favor of the alternative hypothesis. For example, if testing if a new drug lowers blood pressure, a small p-value would suggest the drug is effective.  However, it's crucial to consider effect size and context, not just the p-value alone.\n",

            "* **5. What is a confidence interval?**\n",
            "    * **Answer:** A confidence interval provides a range of values within which a population parameter (like the mean) is likely to fall with a certain level of confidence (e.g., 95%).  For instance, a 95% confidence interval for the average height of women might be [162cm, 168cm], meaning we are 95% confident that the true average height lies within this range.\n",

A correlation between ice cream sales and crime rates doesn't imply that ice cream causes crime (or vice-versa).  Causation implies that one variable directly influences another.  To establish causation, you need controlled experiments or strong evidence ruling out other factors.\n",

Logistic regression predicts the probability of a binary outcome (0 or 1) using a sigmoid function applied to a linear combination of input features.  Linear regression predicts a value (house price), while logistic regression predicts a probability (likelihood of customer churn).\n",
            "\n",
            "* **8. Explain how a decision tree works.**\n",
            "    * **Answer:** A decision tree recursively partitions the data based on features to create a tree-like structure.  Each internal node represents a feature, each branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents an outcome.  The goal is to build a tree that accurately predicts the outcome based on the feature values.\n",

            "* **9. Describe the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm.**\n",
            "    * **Answer:** K-NN is a non-parametric method for classification or regression.  It classifies a new data point based on the majority class among its k-nearest neighbors in the feature space.  For regression, it averages the values of the k-nearest neighbors.  The choice of 'k' and distance metric is important.\n",

            "        * **Cross-validation:** Evaluating the model on unseen data during training.\n",
            "        * **Regularization:** Adding penalty terms to the model's loss function to discourage complex models.\n",

For new brands seeking attention, a higher-temperature approach can yield standout names, but lower temperatures offer familiarity and trust—which is also valuable for consumer technology. A blended approach (medium temperature or careful curation) often yields the best results for product naming.\n"
